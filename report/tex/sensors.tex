\chapter{Sensors}

\section{Introduction}
Modern smartphones have many sensors, and most of them can extend robot's
functionality. Sensors differ between phones, and new (or more advanced) ones can
be connected using possible connections (mostly USB and Bluetooth).
Most popular ones are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item touch screen,
  \item accelerometer,
  \item gyroscope,
  \item microphone(s),
  \item front and rear camera(s),
  \item position sensors:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item GPS,
    \item multilateration based on GSM and/or WiFi,
  \end{itemize}
  \item magnetometer,
  \item light sensor,
  \item proximity sensor.
\end{itemize}
Some (mostly high-end, or specialized ones) have also sensors like electronic
compass, humidity/temperature sensors, fingerprint scanner, or even thermal
camera.

% TODO write about face detecting
Available implementations of face detection includes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item FaceDetector API,
  \item Camera API,
  \item OpenCV for Android,
  \item OpenCV NDK.
\end{itemize}

% TODO short description

% hard to obtain bitmap from camera

% TODO screenshot + code sample

\section{Camera API}
% max 5 faces
% 30 ms in good light/on screen, 60 ms in bad
% resolution doesn't have impact on speed, only on quality
% detection in background
