\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Description of problem}
Nowadays, popularity of robots is on the raise. 
It's not hard to built a~simple one, and Internet is full of tutorials how to
build them.
They are built using specially programmed microcontrollers (MCUs), and simplest
ones even without any.
However, MCUs have some limitations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item They have limited memory and computational capability.
  \item They require a~lot of low-level configuration and programming.
  \item Each MCU model requires (at least) slightly different configuration.
  \item It's hard to look for help (e.g. on Stack Overflow,
  \cite{stack_overflow}) for specific MCU.
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, usage of Android smartphones as high-level controllers, sending
commands to MCU as low-level one, should be worth considering, because of:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Lot of memory and powerful processors.
  \item Many built-in sensors.
  \item Many ways to communicate with surroundings, especially -
  with MCU.
  \item Popularity of Android platform:
  	\begin{itemize}
  	  \item tutorials,
  	  \item devices,
  	  \item solutions on Stack Overflow,
  	  \item external libraries.
  	\end{itemize}
  \item Compatibility between smartphones and Android versions.
  \item High-level programming and reduced low-level configuration.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Goal of a~project}
Goal of this project is to check, if Android smartphone:
\begin{itemize}
  \item can communicate with microcontroller,
  \item can extend functionality of robots using its built-in sensors.
\end{itemize}
Found solutions should be analyzed with attention to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item compatibility,
  \item performance,
  \item difficulty of implementation.
\end{itemize}
Two Android smartphones (with different performance and Android version) will be
used: Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo and Motorola Moto G LTE.
Communication with MCU will be realized through USB cable.
Face detection using built-in camera will be used as an example of extending
MCU's capabilities - it requires both computing power and sensors not available
in MCU, and there exists several ways to implement this.

As MCU, a~Freescale FRDM KL26Z will be used. 
\cite{mcu_on_eclipse} is a~blog dedicated to development on Freescale platform
(mostly KL25Z, predecessor of KL26Z), and even contains an article how to built a~mobile robot on that
platform (img. \ref{img:frd_zumo}).
It has articles how to use most of those MCUs features, however from
smartphone's point of view, only communication using USB port (KL25Z and KL26Z
have two of them) is required.

Because of already working solutions on Freescale's MCUs (described in
State-of-Art section), there is no need to build an actual, working robot - it's
proven, that those MCUs can be used as a~controlling unit of a~robot.
Therefore, this thesis focuses only on making use of smartphone for detecting
position of face (as in robot on img. \ref{img:SoA0}, but with Android instead
of PC) and sending text command to MCU (also as in \ref{img:SoA0}, but on
Android, not PC).

\section{Content of thesis}
This thesis contains:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Introduction - this chapter.
  \item Platforms - chapter describing MCU, Android, and used equipment.
  \item Communication - chapter about communication between smartphone and MCU.
  \item Sensors - chapter about extending robot's capabilities by using one of
  smartphone's sensors - camera.
  \item Summary - chapter with conclusions, whether Android smartphone can be
  used as high-level controller.
  \item Bibliography.
\end{enumerate}
All code used in this thesis can be found on disc attached to archive version,
or in git repository on Github: \url{https://github.com/Koval92/MastersThesis}

\section{State of Art}
State of Art can be divided into three different areas:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Robots working on Freescale's MCU.
  \item Robots controlled by mobile phones.
  \item ``Followers''.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Robots working on Freescale's MCU}
Good example of such robot can be Freedom Zumo Robot, described in one of posts
on \cite{mcu_on_eclipse} (img. \ref{img:frd_zumo}).
It's built on FRDM KL25Z, and Zumo Robot Kit for Arduino - KL25Z (and KL26Z
probably too) is compatible with it.

Another example could be a~robot built for one of previous projects - it will be
described later.
Therefore, it's proven, that this MCU can be used for building (at least simple)
robots.

\subsection{Robots controlled by mobile phones}
Next category are robots controlled by mobile phones, like ones shown on photos
\ref{img:SoA1}, \ref{img:SoA2} and \ref{img:SoA3}.
It seems, that all of them all remotely-controlled using another phone -
clicking on button during phone call with receiver generates a~sound, which is received and transformed into
signal in headphones' port.
None of examples have any (additional) logic in phone. 

Some examples of robots controlled by additional program on smartphones
still exist, but most of them either are poorly documented, or are using
smartphone only as a~remote, not part of the robot. 

The best example was line-following (it was also an example of both other
categories) robot developed by co-students Krzysztof Taborski and Kamil Szyc,
but it wasn't published anywhere.
Part of their code was even used as one of methods to communicate between
Android and MCU.

\subsection{``Followers''}
Last category of robots are ``Followers'', designed to follow something.
Most popular ones are rather simple line-followers, which are built for
tournaments, where they have to finish the route, marked with a~single line, in
shortest time.
Another example, much more complicated, could be following face (e.g. during
video conference) - it can't be realized with simple color detection. 
It requires a~camera and more computational power, than MCUs can offer.
One of such robots was the one designed for one of previous projects (fig.
\ref{img:SoA0}). 
\includeimage{SoA0}{FaceFollower by Michał Kowalski and Adam Ćwik}

It was extremely big one, because it was using a~laptop as controller
and external camera on a~tripod, and all of that needed to be placed on a~robot.
It was also using one on Freescale's microprocessors.

Camera was capturing video, application developed for laptop was responsible for
detecting faces on it, and then was sending message with command to MCU over
USB cable, which was responsible for translating it into steering for wheels and
so on.
MCU also echoed back commands and was informing about current position and speed
of wheels, read from encoders on them. All of that required sending several
characters long strings in both directions.

Main idea behind this thesis, is to check, if smartphones can be used to
miniaturize such robot, by replacing laptop and external camera with much
smaller, but not much worse, device.
Therefore, only checking possibility and performance of face detection and
communication with MCU needs to be done.
