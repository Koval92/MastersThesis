\chapter{Communication}

\section{Introduction}
Three ways to communicate over USB were found:
\begin{itemize}
  \item USB Host API \cite{android_reference},
  \item usb-serial-for-android library by mik3y \cite{mik3y},
  \item UsbSerial by felHR85 \cite{felHR85}.
\end{itemize}
Because of similar names of projects, they will be referenced as Host API,
mik3y and felHR85.

\section{USB Host API}

{../code_samples/bulktransfer_sample.java}

\includeimage{comm/bulk/bulk_1}{USB Host API - sending 1 letter}
[\\Received text is correct. As it can be seen, in this test it takes about 22
ms to get an echo of each sent message. Although, during other (not documented
with screenshot) tests, sometimes (but less often) average duration was about 12
ms.]

\includeimage{comm/bulk/bulk_32}{USB Host API - sending 32 letters}
[\\Received text is correct. Average time of execution was 12 ms, but in other
tests, it also happened (but less often) to be 22 ms.]

\includeimage{comm/bulk/bulk_50}{USB Host API - sending 50 letters}
[\\Received text is correct. Average time of execution was 12 ms, but in
opposition to sending 1 or 32 letters, other values were not observed.]

\includeimage{comm/bulk/bulk_64}{USB Host API - sending 64 letters}
[\\Received text is NOT correct. Only first message is received completely, but
sent from MCU as two. Next ones are missing last character, and have last
non-missed character from previous one at the beginning.]

\subsection{Division of messages}
% TODO division of messages

\includeimage{comm/div/div_async_cdc}{Division of message: async-cdc}
[\\Text is received in one message. Semicolon is visible on line with next
message, because MCU sends new line character (``\textbackslash n''), and
semicolor is added on Android side after that.]

\includeimage{comm/div/div_async_cdc2}{Division of message: async-cdc with too
long message}
[\\Result is interesting, because each message is received as two: 64
chars long, and 5 chars long (``5432'' + `` \textbackslash n'').]

\includeimage{comm/div/div_async_uart}{Division of message: async-uart}
[\\As it can be seen, message is usually send letter by letter, with few
exceptions. Interesting is fact, that ``uart: '' string is received only at the
beginning (and sometimes later, not visible on screen), which means, that it's
in reading loop the whole time - empty input stream should cause sending ``
\textbackslash n'' and ``uart: ``.]

\includeimage{comm/div/div_sync_uart}{Division of message: sync-uart}
[\\MCU still reads and sends message char-by-char, but smartphone reads them in
blocks. It can also be seen, that all blocks are correct, and errors can be
seen only between them. Also in this case, ``uart: `` can be seen only from
time to time, but more frequently than in ``sync'' version.]
